# Ecoin Trends
 
## Introduction
-
    Ever since the inception of bitcoins, electronic coins have become
very popular to invest money in.  If invested early, bitcoin value grew
exponentially for a long time.  Since then, there have been competors.
Just as in the e-commerce field, ebay was the only game in town for a
while.  Amazon replaced ebay, and there were very many other competitors
that people can sell a decent amount of inventory.  The competetors to
bitcoin include Litecoin, Ethereum, Zcash, and Dash.  I have been recenlty
been watching the trends of coins.  So far I have done the best with Etherum.
I also wanted to experiment with AI deep learning.

## Method #1: Deep Learning with Tensorflow

  I am very interested in using deep learning to help me with my choices.
I decided to use Tensorflow to analyize past trends.  I chose to put
previous values at previous time points, to consider if it is a safe bet
that it will go up within a certain time period.  I am using a library
for Tensorflow, using a thing called Estimators,
Here is a screenshot of the preduction.  Right now I am using google colab

## Method #2 : Facebook's prophet AI deep learning

  I recently found that Facebook has an easy interface for
 predicting univariate trends.  This is integrated as a 
 python library.

 Utimately, you can compare the different coins, invest based
 on which Prophet AI is showing a faster increase.

## Method #3: Find bottom price

    I decided to make a program that scans the history, and
finds the lowest value over a certain time interval

## Method #4: Traditional Regression
-
    There are many statistical methods to use for choosing coins.  Lately,
there has been a surge in cryptocurrency coins.  Different regressions, of
course, could help decide which coin to buy

    To start with, I decided to download the coin price history from yahoo.
I then used numpy to compare the percent change
